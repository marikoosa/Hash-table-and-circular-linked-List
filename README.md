# Hash table and circularly linked List

## Circular linked list supports a priority queue

* 2D collection of “Cells” uses a stack and a queue to traverse the grid and print off it’s contents.

* Push/enqueue cells are traversed in the following order: right, below, left, above.

## Hash table is implemented using an array

* Hash table stores series of strings, these words are hashed and then stored in the array based on their index (the index being the result of the hash function). 

* Using quadratic probing array size is inputted as a parameter when it’s created.
